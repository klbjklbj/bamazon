
This app was created with Node.js and MySQL.

The file bamazonCustomer.js prompts users with two messages...The first asks the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy. Once the user/customer has placed the order, the application will check if th store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
If not, the app will log a phrase like Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through.



However, if your store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order.


This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity.
Once the update goes through, show the customer the total cost of their purchase.
