
This app was created with Node.js and MySQL.

The file bamazonCustomer.js prompts users with two messages...The first asks the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message asks how many units of the product they would like to buy. Once the user/customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If there is not enough inventory 
the app will prevent the order from going through, let the user know, ask them to make a different order. If the store has enough of the product, the app will complete the order by giving the user the total order cost and by updating SQL database with the new inventory total.
